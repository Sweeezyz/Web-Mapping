# Web-Mapping
Interactive Mapping of Population, Volcanoes, and Personal Locations
This is a simple Python code that uses 2 libraries: Folium and Pandas
Make sure to have them already installed using:

Folium: pip install folium

Pandas: pip install pandas

Once complete, download the Volcanoes.txt file, and work your way around the code
I've left comments inside to make things easier, so please read them. Manipulate the code as you wish, try adding your files and experimenting with them. Have fun!
